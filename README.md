🎨 Old-School Layout Revamp
📝 Project Overview
This project is a modern, responsive implementation of a classic web page layout originally designed in a college group project with Daniel Aguilar, Johnny Tran, and Javier Franco.

Now with advanced front-end development experience, I’ve rebuilt the layout using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5, following current best practices in responsive design, accessibility, and performance optimization.

🛠️ Tech Stack
🔧 HTML5 – Semantic markup for structure and SEO

🎨 CSS3 – Custom styling with utility enhancements

🧱 Bootstrap 5 – Responsive grid system and prebuilt components

📱 Mobile-First Design – Optimized for all device sizes

🧩 Component-Based Layout – Reusable sections

⚡ Performance Optimized – Minimal dependencies, efficient styling

🌐 Cross-Browser Compatibility

♿ Accessible by Design

💡 Purpose
Revisit a nostalgic design with modern tools

Practice clean, maintainable front-end development

Showcase UI/UX evolution and developer growth
